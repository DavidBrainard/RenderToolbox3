% Add an entry to the recipe's execution log.
%   @param recipe a recipe struct
%   @param comment index optional comment to include with the log
%   @param executed a script/function name/handle that was executed
%   @param errorData a Matlab exception or other error data, if any

%
% @details
% Appends the given @a executed, @a errorData, and @a executiveIndex to the
% execution log of the given @a recipe.  Also appends the current date and
% time, current user name, and current computer's host name.
%
% @details
% Users may supply an optional string @a comment to include with other
% logged data.
%
% @details
% @a executed should be the name of a script or function, or a
% function_handle that was executed on the given @a recipe.  This is the
% thing that happened that should be logged.
%
% @details
% @a errorData should be a Matlab exception that was caught, or any other
% error data that resulted from @a executed.  @a errorData should only be
% empty of no error occured.
%
% @details
% If @a executed is one of the scripts or functions listed in @a
% recipe.executive, then @a executiveIndex should be the index of @a
% executed within @a recipe.executive.  RenderToolbox3 functions will
% always supply @a executiveIndex in order to track the progress of a
% recipe's execution.  Users may omit @a executiveIndex.
%
% @details
% Returns the given @a recipe, with the given logging information appended.

% @details
% Usage:
%   recipe = AppendRecipeLog(recipe, comment, executed, errorData, executiveIndex)
%
