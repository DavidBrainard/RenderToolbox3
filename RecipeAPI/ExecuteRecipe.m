% Execute the given recipe and make long entries.
%   @param recipe a recipe struct to be cleaned
%   @param whichExecutives indices to select specific scripts or functions
%   @param throwException whether to re-throw a Matlab MException
%
% @details
% First calls ConfigureForRecipe(), then executes each of the scripts or
% functions in the given recipe.input.executive, and makes a log entry for
% each.  If a corresponding log entry already exists, skips that script or
% funciton and moves on to the next.
%
% @details
% To make sure that no executive scripts or functions are skipped, first
% call CleanRecipe() or supply @a whichExecutives explicitly.
%
% @details
% By default, tries to execute all of the scripts and functions in
% recipe.input.executive.  If @a whichExecutives is provided, it must be an
% array of indices used to select specific scripts or functions.  All and
% onlythese elements of recipe.input.executive will be executed, regardless
% of whether corresponding log entries exist.
%
% @details
% If any executive script or recipe throws an error, logs the error and
% stops executing.  If @a throwException is true (the default), and the
% error is a Matlab MException, rethrows the exception to produce a stack
% trace in the command window.
%
% @details
% Returns the given @a recipe, with @a recipe.log filled in.

% Usage:
